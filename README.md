# ES6 101
Welcome to ES6 101! In this assignment you will learn es6 basics, including
arrow functions, classes, splat, spread, const, let, etc. By the end of this
assignment you should have a seperate file for each example in the answers
folder named after the example number like this:

```javascript
// ./answers/example42.js
const hereIs = myAnswer();
console.log(hereIs);
```

This file you can then run with `node ./answers/example42.js` to see all the output as you
work.

Ok lets get started!
